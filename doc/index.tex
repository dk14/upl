\section{UPL: Universal Processing Language}

\subsection{History}

The objective of this project is to create small and compact
language for payment transaction processing. Underlying instrumentation
code should be KVS layer for storing transaction chains but
naturally should be extended to different backends like Java,
PL/SQL and other languages currently involved in banking card processing.

Pocessing systems are using manually crafted application
relays to handle card processing business rules. Being defined by business
analysts these rules are fallen down to engineering teams informally.
Approach we provide pushes card processing to solid background in a form
of domain specific language common for all card plans analytics departments.

Having compact language we can formally build various translators
for particular customers and existing processing systems. At the same time
we provide reference back-end Erlang system implementation
for transactions processing. Also DSL gives us a natural and easy
verification strategies and compactifications.

This language could be easily extended to other domain aread like
internet payment processing, shopping mall bonus programs, mobile
operators tariff plans.
